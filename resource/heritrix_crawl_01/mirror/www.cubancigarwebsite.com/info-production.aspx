				In 1907 Cuban botanists, researching the indigenous Cuban black tobacco <i>(Tabaco Negro Cubano)</i>, developed a seed variety <i>
				Habanensis</i>, which had the characteristic Cuban taste but was more disease resistant.<br/>
				<br/>
				Around 1940, an improved seed variety <i>Criollo</i> was developed, and later a sub-variety <i>Corojo</i> was developed for wrappers.&nbsp; 
				In 1992, <i>Habana 2000</i> was introduced.&nbsp; This was followed in 1998 by <i>Criollo 98</i>.<br/>
				<br/>
	        	In 2006 more resistant hybrids were developed, being <i>Habano 2006</i> 
				(from <em>Habana 2000</em> &amp; <em>Criollo 1998</em>) which are being used for the 2006/07 crop.&nbsp;
		    	 These new hybrids are more disease resistant, have extra leaves, and do not flower.<br/>
				<br />
				The growing condition of the plants and the leaf location determines its final use.&nbsp;
				Plants are either sun grown or shade grown.&nbsp;

				<br/>
       			Tobacco for premium Habanos cigars is a single yearly crop.&nbsp; 
       			From soil preparation to the end of harvesting is around nine months.&nbsp; 
       			The soil and plants requires extensive irrigation and care.<br/>
				<br/>
				Reports of second (or third) crops does not apply to Habanos cigar tobacco.<br /><br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Selection of the Seed</span><br />
				<br />
				Selection of the tobacco seed is the responsibility of Cuba's Tobacco Research Station.&nbsp; They 
				distribute the seed free-of-charge to the growers (<em>Vegueros</em>).<br />
				<br/>
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Growing the Seed</span><br />
				<br>
				The tradition method of growing the seeds was in externally located open seed beds.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				This is now being replaced by a system comprising soil-filled plastic trays, floating on a 
				&quot;hydroponic like&quot; water and fertiliser system. These growing areas are located externally but 
				are enclosed with a plastic tent-like structure.<br>
				<br>
				After 45 to 50 days, the seedlings are ready to plant-out.<br />
				<br/>
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Preparation of the Soil</span><br />
				<br />
				Preparation of the soil traditionally starts on the 15th September each year.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				The premium tobacco 
				areas continue to use the tradition method of oxen and plough, however agricultural machinery is slowing 
				being introduced.&nbsp; The soil is fertilised with organic matter.<br />
				<br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Planting the Seedlings</span><br />
				<br />

				The seedlings are planted into the prepared soil by hand.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				Around 30,000 seedlings are 
				planted per hectare.&nbsp; 
				The fields are progressively planted to spread out the farmers burden.<br />
				<br/>
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Tending the Crop</span><br />
				<br>
				Tending the crop is extremely intensive.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				Around 3 to 4 weeks after planting out, the 
				soil is banked up around the base of the plant to promote a strong root system.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				As each plant 
				reached its desired height the top bud is manually removed to promote leaf growth.&nbsp; This de-budding 
				also causes undesirable side root growth, which must be manually removed from the plants every few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				During this time, careful and constant irrigation must be carried out.<br>
				<br>
				For the areas destined for wrapper leaf, the fields must be enclosed under canopies of muslin 
				cloth with 10 to 20 days after planting out.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				The filler and binder leaf are grown fully in the open.<br />
				<br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Harvesting</span><br />
				<br />
				Around 40 days after planting out, the 30 day harvesting cycle begins.<br />
				<br>
				Picking starts from the bottom of the plant, picking the 2 or 3 lowest small leafs.&nbsp; This first picking 
				leaf is normally destine to small machine made cigars. <br>
				<br>
				After 7 days the main picking occurs, on a 3 day cycle.<br>
				<br>
				For shade-grown plants the lower leaves (for lighter coloured wrapper) are picked.&nbsp; Subsequent 
				pickings progress upwards to the darker 
				coloured wrapper leaf at the top of the plant.<br>
				<br>
				For sun-grown plants, the second picking is for the Volado for lighter-flavoured filler and for binders.&nbsp; 
				Next is the Seco leaf suitable for medium-flavoured filler leaf.&nbsp;Next is the Ligero, the 
				full-flavoured filler leaf.&nbsp;Finally, some plants produce the prized Medio Tiempo filler leaf, used 
				only in some super premium or special release cigars.<br>
				<br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Curing</span><br />
				<br />

				Curing is another labour intensive and complex process.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				Wrapper leaf is air-dried in special curing barns for around 50 days.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				Filler leaf is also air-dried but is exposed to a 5 to 7 day external sun-drying period both before and 
				after the barn curing.<br>
				<br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Sorting, Stripping, &amp; Fermentation</span><br />
				<br />

				For wrapper leaf, the leaves are moistened before classifying and sorting each leaf by size .&nbsp; The 
				classified wrappers are wrapper in jute cloth and allowed to rest for for 10 to 15 days, before 
				grouping, bundling, and finally bailing the wrapper leaf, ready to ship to the factories.<br>
				<br>
				For filler and binder leaf the initial sorting process is similar to the wrapper leaf.&nbsp; The leaf is 
				then stacked into piles and undergoes a 30 to 50 day fermentation process.&nbsp; During this period the 
				&quot;pile&quot; temperatures is carefully monitored and controlled.&nbsp; <br>
				<br>
				After fermentation, the filler leaf is 
				stripped of its centre vain, packed and bailed and sent to storage rooms for aging.&nbsp;
				The fermentation process reduces acidity, tar, and nicotine and smoothes the flavour of the filler leaf 
				and evens out the colour of the wrapper leaf.<br>
				<br />
				<hr />
			<br />
				<span class="head3">Storage &amp; Aging</span><br />
            	<br />

            	In the warehouse, the leaf is stored to age.&nbsp; 
				From 2006, Habanos has increased the minimum aging time as follows:<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>Fillers..........<i>Ligero</i> - 3 years</li>
				<li>Fillers..........<i>Seco</i> - 2 years</li>
				<li>Fillers..........<i>Volado</i> - 1 year</li>
				<li>Binders........Generally - 1 year</li>
				<li>Wrappers.....Generally - 1 year</li>
				<li>Wrappers.....Limited Editions - 2 years</li>
				<li>Wrappers.....Cohiba Maduro - 5 years</li>

				The full size (<em>Tripa Larga</em>) filler leaves are then gathered, folded, and aligned (to ensure a clear passage) .&nbsp; 
				The leaves are arranged with the lighter flavoured tips at the foot of the cigar.&nbsp; 
				The stronger flavoured slower burning <i>Ligero</i> leaf is placed along the centre of the cigar.<br/>
				<br/>
				Next the bunch is formed by rolling the filler onto the laid-out binder leaf, starting at the foot.&nbsp; 
				The head of the bunch is guillotined and the bunch is pressed into a timber mould to form the shape.<br/>
				<br/>
				After this stage, the bunches are subject to a suction draw test.&nbsp; 
				This testing commenced circa 2002; initially only random cigars were suction tested for minimum draw pressure.&nbsp; 
				Now every cigar undergoes a suction test to satisfy both minimum and maximum draw pressures.<br/>
				<br/>
				The wrapper is then prepared, smooth side out.&nbsp; 
				After trimming the exposed edge, the formed bunch is laid on the wrapper and rolled, starting at the cigar's foot.&nbsp; 
				The cap is then fitted and the cigar guillotined to length.<br />

				<span class="head3">Handmade Short-Filler Cigars - <i>Totalmente a Mano Tripa Corta</i></span><br />
				<br />
				Handmade Short Filler cigars have a filler composed of leaf trimmings  
				from the bunches of long filler cigars combined with other selected chopped tobacco, but full size binders and wrappers are used. <br />
				<br />
				Some short-filler cigars are still produced by Habanos SA.<br />
				<br/>
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Machine-made Cigars - <i>Mecanizado</i></span><br />
            	<br />
				Machine-made cigars were produced from the 1950s and were made with either long or short filler tobacco.&nbsp; 
				They could be produced in large quantities and were significantly cheaper than hand-made cigars.<br />
				<br />
				Almost all machine-made cigars were once produced in both fully machine-made and hand-finished versions.<br />
				<br />
				There was a significant phasing out of machine-made cigars between 2002 and 2005.&nbsp;
				By 2006, no machine made cigars remained in the Habanos SA range.<br />
				<br />
				<hr />
			<br/>
				<span class="head3">Hand-Finished Cigars</span><br />
				<br />

				Machine-bunched hand-finished cigar had the filler and binder bunched by machine but the wrapper was applied by hand.<br />
				<br />
				Hand finishing of machine bunched cigars (by the hand application of the wrapper) was reduced in the 1990s 
				and was fully phased out by circa 2002.<br />
				<br />
				No longer produced by Habanos SA. <br />
				<br />
				<hr />
			<br />
				<span class="head3">Small Cigars</span><br />
				<br />

				Small cigars are classified as machine-made cigars that weigh less than 3 grams and use short filler tobacco.&nbsp; 
				They are available in some Cuban cigar brand names.&nbsp; This range includes the Mini, Club, and Puritos.<br/>
	    		<br/>
	    		Before circa 2001, they were produced outside Cuba using 100% Cuban Tobacco.&nbsp; 
	    		Since then they have been produced in Cuba and therefore can be legally called Cuban cigars.<br />
				<br/>
				In circa 2005 mini cigars were taken out of the Habanos range, and are now produced by <i>Internacional Cubana de Tabacos, S.A.</i><br />
				<br />

				<span class="head3">Cigarettes</span><br />
        	    <br />

        	    Cigarettes made from Cuban tobacco are available in some Cuban cigar brand names.<br />
				<br />
				Cigarettes are not listed in this website.<br />
				<br />
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Fumigation &amp; Conditioning</span><br />
				<br />
				Before packing, the cigars are fumigated with Phosphine (Phosphorus 
		  		Hydride) to control the tobacco beetle <i>Serricorne</i>, and then conditioned in bundles in cedar lined 
				cabinets, to reduce and stabilise their moisture.&nbsp; 
				These cabinets are maintained between 16&#176;C - 18&#176;C and 65% - 70% RH.<br />
				<br/>
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3"><a name="Quality_Control">Quality Control</a></span><br />
				<br />
				Quality control is provided by testing and supervision during the rolling, and 
				later by both non-destructive and destructive testing.<br/>
				<br/>
				The supervisors are expert rollers, who are mainly involved in 
				checking technique, construction and physical cigar sizes at the rolling tables.&nbsp; 
				Each cigar must pass a suction draw test before the wrapper is applied.<br/>
				<br/>
				After leaving the roller, the cigars go to the quality control 
				section, where each cigar is checked for weight, length, ring size, 
				consistency, construction and appearance.<br/>
				<br/>
				Samples are also opened up to check internal filler construction, arrangement, and blending of the leaf.<br/>
				<br/>
				Finally, a sample of the cigars are test-smoked to ensure that they 
				are consistent with the required character of the vitola.&nbsp; 
				They are graded for draw, burn, aroma, flavour, strength, and overall quality.<br/>
				<br/>
            	General consensus is that there has been a substantially overall improvement in Cuban cigars (due to improved and additional quality 
				control and the older aged filler leaf now being used).&nbsp; This improvement has been especially apparent since 2006 and these cigars 
				now smoke better and earlier.<br />

				<span class="head3"><a name="Freezing">Freezing</a></span><br />
            	<br />

            	In addition to fumigation, freezing of the finished cigars is used to 
				kill the tobacco beetle <i>Lasioderma serricorne.</i><br/>
				<br/>
				Freezing of cigars commenced around early 2005.&nbsp; 
				It is carried out in the Habanos main temperature and humidity controlled storage and distribution building.&nbsp; 
				This, combined with fumigation, is intended to kill all eggs, insects, and lava within the tobacco.<br/>
				<br/>
				Some regional distributors had their own freezing facilities, predating the Habanos plant.<br/>

				<span class="head3">Generally</span><br/>
				<br />
				In 2002 Tabacuba began consolidating the production of 
				their various brands into key factories, a step that is viewed as a major improvement.<br/>
				<br/>
				Under the old system, the production of most brands was spread out among various factories, but maintaining 
				consistent blends and quality proved inefficient and difficult.<br />
				<br />
				The following is only the briefest summary of some of the more important or current factories. For a full treatise on this 
				subject, the publication <em>The Great Habanos Factories</em> by <em>Adriano Martinez Rius</em> is recommended.<br />
