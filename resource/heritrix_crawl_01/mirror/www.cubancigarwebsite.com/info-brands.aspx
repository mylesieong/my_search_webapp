				The current Habanos S.A. portfolio consists of 27 brands, grouped by world availability.<br/>
<div>
			  	<ul>
					<li>Global............7 brands......available worldwide</li>
					<li>Niche.............3 brands......specialty brand</li>
					<li>Multi-local.....5 brands......available most countries</li>
					<li>Local............12 brands......limited to a few countries</li>
				</ul>
</div>

				<br />
				The grouping was last changed circa 2007, when H. Upmann and Jose L. Piedra 
				were upgraded from Multi-local brands to Global brands; and 
				Quintero was downgraded from a Global brand to a Multi-local brand.<br />
				<br />
				The Global and Niche brands are considered the Habanos premium 
				brands, that are promoted on a worldwide basis and account for 
				the bulk of their total sales.<br />
				<br />
				All Habanos cigars are now handmade (<em>Totalmente a Mano</em>) and are virtually all long filler 
				cigars (<em>Tripa Larga</em>).<br/>
				<br/>
				The
				Jose L. Piedra, La Flor de Cano, and Quintero brands all currently comprise short filler cigars (<em>Tripa Corta</em>).<br />
				<br />
				The
				Por Larra√±aga, Rafael Gonzalez, and Fonseca brands all currently contain a single short filler cigar (<em>Tripa Corta</em>).<br/>

				Sales and Revenue figures are generally a close-kept secret within Habanos SA.&nbsp; In a surprising 
				lapse, the following figures for 2006 were &quot;published&quot;.<br />
				<br />
				Reportedly just seven of the 27 current export brands account for 83 percent of all cigars sold and contribute 82 percent of all sales revenue.&nbsp; These brands are:<br />
				<div>
				<p class="indent-40L">Montecristo: 23% of all cigars sold; 29% of all revenue.<br />
				Romeo y Julieta: 15% of all cigars sold; 12% of all revenue.<br />
				Partagas: 12% of all cigars sold; 12% of all revenue.<br />
				Cohiba: 11% of all cigars sold; 20% of all revenue.<br />
				Jose L. Piedra: 11% of all cigars sold; 2% of all revenue.<br />
				Quintero: 5% of all cigars sold; 2% of all revenue.<br />
				Hoyo de Monterrey: 4% of all cigars sold; 5% of all revenue. <br />
					  </p>
				</div>Figures for other well-known brands are:<br />
				<div>
					  <p class="indent-40L">H. Upmann: 2.4% of all cigars sold, 2.1% of all revenue.<br />
				Trinidad: 1.5% of all cigars sold, 2.5% of all revenue.<br />
					  </p>
				</div>
				The
				Bolivar, Punch and Ramon Allones brands barely register, however this position may well have changed with the 
				introduction of the Regional Edition Series, as these three brands alone have had in excess of 60 releases to 
				date (2013). <br />
				<br />
				The largest selling cigar is the Montecristo No.4 (a Petit Corona) with a 8% market share.<br />
				<br />
				Early 2009 figures reveal the following market order: <br />
				<div>
					  <p class="indent-40L">Montecristo.<br />
				Romeo y Julieta.<br />
				Jose L. Piedra.<br />
				Cohiba.<br />
				Partag√°s.<br />
				Hoyo de Monterrey.<br />
				Quintero.<br />
				H. Upmann.

				<a name="Unification_of_the_Cuban_Cigar_Industry">Significant Cuban Cigar Events</a></span> <br/>
				<br/>
				The following periods are significant within the Cuba's industrial cigar history:<br/>
				<br/>
			
				<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Pre-Revolution</span><br />
				<br/>
				Before the Revolution, the Cuban cigar industry was not centralised.&nbsp; 
				There was no system or rules to follow.&nbsp; 
				All manufacturers were independent, ranging from the very small to the very large.&nbsp; 
				Every manufacturer was free to produce whatever cigars and packaging style that they desired.<br/>
				<br/>
			
				<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">The Revolution</span><br />
				<br/>
				The Revolution occurred on 2 January 1959.&nbsp; After this, it was business as usual for the cigar industry.&nbsp; Firms remained independent.&nbsp; 
				The Cuban cigar price list effective from 1st January 1959 showed 140 brands undertaking export production.&nbsp; 
				There were a total of 1,185 vitolas available, comprising 999 
				in production and further 186 available by special order.<br/>
				<br/>
			
			<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Nationalisation</span><br />
				<br/>
				On 15 September 1960, all private businesses were ‚Äúnationalised‚Äù and become the property of the Cuban government.&nbsp;
				Many business proprietors of the Cuban factories fled the country.&nbsp; 
				While there was general chaos, Cuban cigar production in many small factories 
				continued, sometimes with only the employees operating the businesses. <br/>
				<br/>
			
				
			<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Cubatabaco Formed</span><br />
				<br/>
				Cubatabaco was formed in February 1962, and immediately appointed Government officials to take over management of all Cuban cigar factories.&nbsp;
				Most small factories were closed down due to lack of man-power.&nbsp; Only major factories remained in operation.&nbsp;
				These factories still remained independent of each other and 
				therefore from a production point of view, still nothing changed from pre-revolution times.<br />
				<br />
				The lack of change was probably due to the new government factory managers knowing very 
				little about cigars, and the Communist system, where there is no reward for positive thinking.&nbsp; 
				Cubatabaco produced its first Catalogue detailing the brands officially produced by the new Government regimen.&nbsp; 
				The number of brands and vitolas was substantially reduced.<br/>
				<br/>
			
			<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">The 1980 Crop Failure</span><br />
				<br/>
				In 1980 blue-mould plant disease wiped out the entire tobacco crop in 1980. 
				With no tobacco, the factories became idle and some were closed.&nbsp; 
				This period of inactivity initiated a historical rationalisation of the Cuban cigar industry.<br />
				<br />
				During this time, a new policy was developed that had three main principles.&nbsp; 
				Every factory could make any brand; the vitola and packaging types were standardised;&nbsp; and uneconomic vitolas or packaging were eliminated.&nbsp;
				A massive trimming of many small selling vitolas occurred, with only some 500 different vitolas remaining. <br/>
				<br/>
			
			<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Altadis SA purchases of 50% of Habanos SA</span><br />
				<br/>
				Prompted by Altadis S.A. purchase and influence, Habanos S.A. decided to dramatically change the way they make and market cigars.&nbsp; 
				This change was carried out over a three year period.&nbsp;
				Instead of having varying degrees of quality within each brand (handmade, hand-finished, &amp; machine-made), 
				Habanos S.A. decided that the major brands will only offer premium ‚Äútotalmente a mano‚Äù hand-rolled cigars. 
				This was to allow consumers to better understand just what sort of cigar they are buying.<br />
				<br />
				Of the 549 vitolas that were manufactured in 1992 (the beginning of Cuba's <i>Special Period</i>) 
				only 319 were to remain in production, and only 33 brands continue to manufactured, and almost all brands saw major changes.&nbsp; 
				Within each brand, vitolas that have the same size but different blends, were axed.&nbsp; 
				Only the best-selling cigar of a vitola was to survive.&nbsp;
				These changes enabled a greater chance of a particular vitola being in stock.&nbsp; 
				The simplification of the brand lines allows the occasional smoker to better understand the range of Habanos.<br />
				<br />
				There were two other significant decisions.&nbsp; 
				Firstly the machine-bunched hand-finished method was to be eliminated, due to economic and 
				marketing simplification reasons.&nbsp; 
				Secondly, the Belinda, Quintero, Jose L. Piedra, Gispert, La Flor del Cano, Cabanas, Los Statos de Luxe, and Troya brands will 
				only be made by either the ‚Äútripa corta‚Äù or ‚Äúmecanizado‚Äù methods.<br/>
				<br/>
			
				<hr />
			
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Extension of the 2001 Policy</span><br />
				<br/>
				Around 2005 Habanos SA decided to carry the 2001 policy further 
				by eliminating all machine-made cigars and brands from their portfolio.&nbsp; 
				This reduced the number of brands to 27 and reduced 
				the number of standard production vitolas to around 240.&nbsp; 
				This was offset by the major increase in production of premium-cost special releases. <br/>
			<br/>
				<hr />
				<br />
				<span class="head3">Purchase of Altadis SA by British Imperial Tobacco (BIT)</span><br />
				<br />
				With the 2008 purchase of Altadis SA, BIT became a 50% owner of Habanos SA. So far, there are no obvious changes arising from the BIT purchase.<br />
